# FluentIter

Nicer iterator patterns for Python! Chain map, filter, zip, unzip, cycle, skip and scan like
there is no tomorrow.

[Straight to the API docs ðŸ‘‰](https://damiondoesthings.github.io/fluentiter/api)

## TLDR:

With **fluentiter** you can do this

```python
lines = iterator(haystack_csv.split("\n"))
header = [x for x in lines.next().split(",") if x.strip(" ")]
needle = (
    lines.map(lambda line: line.split(","))
    .map(lambda values: {k: v for k, v in zip(header, values)})
    .filter(lambda value_dct: value_dct["material"] != "hay")
    .find(lambda value_dct: value_dct["type"] == "needle")
)
```

instead of this

```python
lines = iter(some_csv.split("\n"))
header = [x for x in next(lines).split(",") if x.strip()]
needle = next(
    filter(
        lambda value_dct: value_dct["material"] != "hay",
        filter(
            lambda value_dct: value_dct["type"] == "needle",
            map(
                lambda values: {k: v for k, v in zip(header, values)},
                map(lambda line: line.split(","), lines),
            ),
        ),
    )
)
```

See the [this example](./examples/parsing.py) for a more complete version.

## Motivation

To me Pythons iterator functions (i.e. `map`, `filter`, `zip`, etc.) always seemed backward.
While generator expressions and list/dict/set comprehensions give you nice left-to-right readability,
`map` and `filter` force you to read "inside-out":

```python
[func(x) for x in something if x == y]
map(func, filter(lambda x: x == y, something))
```

This is not an issue for short an simple statements, as they can be written concisely using expressions, but chaining multiple operations,
will result in either many intermediate variable assignements or serious spaghettification.

## How to use

Any `Iterable` can be turned into a `FluentIterator` by just passing it to the `iterator` function:

```python
from fluentiter import iterator
bugs = ["john", "paul", "ringo", "george"]

fluent = iterator(bugs)
# you can now do
# fluent.map(...).filter(...).cycle(...).scan(...) and so on
```

The `FluentIterator` provides a rich set of methods you can call **and chain together** to your liking:

Of course there are the classic `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions, but also some more really useful features like `cycle` to repeat an iterator forever, `find` to find an element or even `partition` to turn your iterator into two.

In total `FluentIterator` provides **35** methods to compose beautiful and easy to follow iteration
patterns.
Check the [API docs](https://damiondoesthings.github.io/fluentiter/) to see them all.
TODO: I probably miscounted,

## Features

- 35 cool fresh iterator methods
- 100% Type annotated e.g. `iterator(["foo", "bar"]).map(len).to_list()` gets correctly inferred as `list[int]`
- 100% Test coverage
- 0 dependencies outside the Python standard library[^0]

## Special Thanks

Thank you to all Rust maintainers for creating the [Iterator trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html), which served as the main source of inspiration.
